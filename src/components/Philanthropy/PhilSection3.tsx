            Communities are only as healthy as those who live in them. Many of
            our projects include or are adjacent to healthcare, medical and
            biotech facilities – not just the lifeblood of care but of
            remarkable research. TMG has donated both time and financial support
            to many of these non-profit and for-profit research hospitals and
            facilities in the hope we can hasten the other “developments” – from
            care to cure, from new findings to successful clinical trials and
            the many advancements that we believe are possible.

            Some of the organizations we support include City of Hope, American
            Heart Association, UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, Dignity Health
            Foundation, American Red Cross Bay Area Chapter, UCSF Foundation,
            Avon Walk to End Breast Cancer, Hospice by the Bay, Planned
