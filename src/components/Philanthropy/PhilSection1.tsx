            As developers, we remain committed to ensuring equal housing
            opportunities throughout our region. This commitment is reflected
            not only in our advocacy but also in our hands-on participation in
            the construction and reconstruction of community properties, as well
            as our support for organizations that champion innovative approaches
            to housing affordability across physical and geographic barriers.

            In October 2017, Michael Covarrubias co-launched a public-private
            partnership with SV@Home, The San Francisco Foundation, the
            Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), and the Association of
            Bay Area Governments (ABAG), forming "CASA – The Committee to House
            the Bay Area." With Denise Pinkston chairing the Production
            Committee, the initiative brought together 50 stakeholders from Bay
            Area housing, for-profit and nonprofit sectors, political and equity
            groups, corporate leaders, labor organizations, and real estate
            developers. The shared goal was to unite diverse voices to address
            the region’s pressing housing challenges. This collaboration
            resulted in the CASA Compact, a 15-year emergency housing plan now
            being advanced to the state legislature. Furthering this mission,
            Pinkston co-founded and now serves as Board President of the Casita
            Coalition, an organization that advocates for increased housing
            choice through small homes—ADUs, cottage clusters, and
            duplexes—throughout California.

            In parallel with our housing efforts, we are equally devoted to
            supporting culture and the arts. We believe that the appreciation
            and preservation of music, dance, theater, and visual arts are
            essential to social and philosophical development. Our support for
            arts institutions helps sustain the creators and their works,
            fostering greater well-being, understanding, and inspiration across
            communities.
