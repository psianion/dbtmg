            All of us at Valor Estate understand the critical need for the
            health, welfare and education of our children, our next generation.
            We believe in charter schools, mentoring, after school athletics and
            job training – whether in technology, manual skills, financial
            analysis or what it takes to fulfill a child’s goals and dreams.
          </p>
          <p className='font-light text-sm text-slate-600 mb-2'>
            Our past contributions supporting the protection and empowerment of
            children and better education in our communities included mentoring
            a young student from Cristo Rey, a private, all-girls Catholic high
            school in San Francisco dedicated to students from underserved
            communities with on-the-job training. We are also strong supporters
            of buildOn whose mission is to engage students in challenging urban
            areas, drawing out their limitless power they can achieve through
            community action.

            Environmental Responsibility
          </p>
          <p className='font-light text-sm text-slate-600 mb-2'>
            The footprint we seek to leave for our next generation demands our
            custodianship of the natural environment through sustainability in
            the built environment, a robust regional transportation system,
            efficient use of our resources, and the preservation of natural
            habitats. We build our projects accordingly, partnering with
            like-minded business and environmental leaders, and supporting
            thoughtful organizations that are on the cutting edge of bettering
            our world – and especially at home here in the Bay Area.
          </p>
          <p className='font-light text-sm text-slate-600 mb-2'>
            One of the most pressing issues in our region is the rise in the sea
            level that threatens the health of the San Francisco Bay ecosystem
            and the communities that surround it. In 2016, TMG Partners made a
            major contribution to People for a Clean and Healthy Bay, a historic
            nine-county Bay Area campaign to help restore the Bay and protect
            the region from flooding.

            Parks Alliance.
